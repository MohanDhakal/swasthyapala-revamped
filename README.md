## About swasthyapala

Whenever we hear the term health we directly relate it to being sick and subconscious mind links it with the nasty environment of hospitals. It doesn’t have to be so if we make ourselves aware and conscious.

Swasthyapala emerges with a concept of building healthy environment around by sharing knowledge and experiences of experts and enthusiasts. Currently the team is focused on writing articles and sharing experiences in categories like Health & Fitness, Food, Agriculture, mental health, and self improvement.
